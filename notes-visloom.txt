Visualise network flows

[x] force directed
    http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045

[ ] still need a table view

[ ] need a ui for datapaths
    [ ] the logical L2 connectivity
    [ ] the logical mesh that may not be HW dependent

[ ] upload to git

[ ] reload the data every N seconds
    [ ] push updates remotely
    [ ] track the current display state
    [ ] call a redraw/index based on state
    [ ] enum variables ?

[x] summarise data when the node count gets too high
    [x] stop at 30-40
    [x] types, #of nodes
    [x] switch view, culls the nodes

[x] show flows between notes
    [ ] show the flow table

[ ] other rendering options
    [ ] fisheye distortion
        http://bost.ocks.org/mike/fisheye/

    [ ] Flare ? if collapsable

    [ ] sankey for flows

    var sankey = d3.sankey()
        .size([width, height])
        .nodeWidth(15)
        .nodePadding(10)
        .nodes(energy.nodes)
        .links(energy.links)
        .layout(32);

    [ ] Chord diagram for flows ?
        http://bost.ocks.org/mike/uberdata/

[x] define a data structure

[x] show entities by type (www, ftp, etc)
    [x] label nodes
    [x] show nodes attached to a type object

[x] show entities by switch 
    [x] animate between this and the by-type view
    [x] show nodes attached to a switch
    [x] show interconnect betwen switches
